## About the Game
<p>This is going to be an educational math game focusing on addition fluency. Players will answer as many addition problems as they can within the allotted one minute of time, and the game will track the number of correct answers the player gets each round. Players can choose between 3 levels (Easy- #’s 1-5, Medium- #’s 1-10, Hard - # 1-20). THe number of correctly answered questions will determine how big the player’s rocket is when it launches after the game. Less than 20 questions will mean your rocket does not take off…</p>
